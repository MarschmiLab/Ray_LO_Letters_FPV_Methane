## Abstract

Floating photovoltaic (FPV) arrays alter the biogeochemistry of waterbodies on which they are deployed. Here, we investigated dissolved methane (CH4) dynamics and associated CH4 cycling microbial communities in the second-year of FPV deployment (70% aerial coverage) in experimental ponds. We found that bottom-water CH4 concentrations were twice as high in ponds with FPV compared to those without. Surface water CH4 concentrations were orders of magnitude lower than bottom-waters, but were similar between ponds with and without FPV. There were no differences in potential sediment CH4 production or CH4 associated microbes. Instead, dissolved CH4 patterns could be explained by elevated abundance of methanotrophic bacteria in the water column of FPV ponds, where late-summer abundances exceeded 1,000,000 cells mL-1. Prolonged periods of CH4 production in low oxygen FPV ponds likely favored blooms of methanotrophs in surface waters where some oxygen is available, mitigating diffusive CH4 emissions to the atmosphere following FPV deployment.



## Significance Statement 

Producing energy using floating photovoltaic (FPV) powerplants offers an opportunity to produce renewable energy, spare land, and reduce evaporation from ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. However, FPV deployment in these ecosystems is associated with colder temperatures, less oxygen availability, and changes in carbon cycling processes. Specifically, experimental evidence demonstrates an increase in concentrations of methane – a potent greenhouse gas – in ponds following FPV deployment. In this study, we investigate how microbial communities associated with aquatic methane cycling differ between ponds with and without FPV. We show that FPV deployment increases bottom-water methane concentrations and triggers dense blooms of methane-oxidizing bacteria. These results provide the first evidence that microbial communities respond strongly to engineered shading and may help buffer greenhouse gas emissions in solar-covered waters.
