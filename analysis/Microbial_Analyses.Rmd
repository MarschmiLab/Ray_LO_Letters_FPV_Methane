# Purpose

We will create a figure to show the difference in methanogens and
methanotrophs in FSP and control ponds at different depths and between
sample types. 

Additionally, I have written the methods and results in this document
which will be added to the google document.

# Load in Data

Loading in our .RData objects.

1. Water samples have flow cytometry derived absolute abundances.

2. Sediments do not have absolute abundance measurements incorporated. Instead, it has been scaled down to the minimum reads. Note: we scale down to the minimum number of reads to standardize/normalize our data to allow for more accurate comparisons between reads to account for uneven sequencing depth across samples (may arise to do seequencing runs or library prep efficiency, etc.)

And we will add in our metadata as well!

```{r load-metadata}
# water physeq with absolute abundance counts, this hasnt pruned the taxa out yet
# load("data/00_load_data/full_abs_physeq.RData")

# or we can also load in water physeq that has absolute abundance as well
load("data/00_load_data/water_physeq.RData")

# sediment scaled physeq
load("data/00_load_data/scaled_sed_physeq.RData")

## Add JDate to the sample_data 
sample_data(scaled_sed_physeq)$JDate <-
  lubridate::yday(sample_data(scaled_sed_physeq)$Date_Collected)

# physeq with water (unincorporated cell counts) + sediment samples = 188 samples total
load("data/00_load_data/new_archaea_rooted_physeq.RData")

## Add JDate to the sample_data 
sample_data(new_archaea_rooted_physeq)$JDate <-
  lubridate::yday(sample_data(new_archaea_rooted_physeq)$Date_Collected)

# load in metadata
load("data/00_load_data/meta_track_23_24.RData")
metadata <- meta_track_23_24
```


# Prepare Phyloseq Objects
Here we will work with our two sample types (water and sediment) for the entire 2024 year. 

We incorporated total cell counts from flow cytometry for water samples (full_abs_physeq.RData)
For our sediment samples, we do not have absolute abundance measures so we will need to calculate the relative abundance and rarify our samples to the minimum read depth (20822)

### Water 
First we will filter out our water samples and save it as a phyloseq.

```{r water-phyloseq}
# filter for all time points in 2024
water_physeq_24 <- subset_samples(water_physeq, Year == "2024")

# prune taxa
water_physeq_24 <- water_physeq_24 %>% 
  prune_taxa(taxa_sums(.) > 0,.)

# melt physeq into data frame for all taxa
water_physeq_ch4_df <- water_physeq_24 %>%
  speedyseq::psmelt() # melt into dataframe

```

### Sediment 
Same as the water samples we will filter out our phyloseq object and save it.

We do not have absolute abundance counts for our sediment samples so we will need to rarefy to the minimum sequencing depth (20826 reads)
```{r sed-phyloseq-24}
# filter phyloseq for only sediment samples
sed_phy <- subset_samples(new_archaea_rooted_physeq, SampleType == "Sediment")

# subset samples 
sed_physeq <- subset_samples(sed_phy, !(sample_names(sed_phy) %in% c("SA_D046", "SA_D047")))

# prune taxa 
sed_phy <- sed_physeq %>% 
  prune_taxa(taxa_sums(.) > 0,.)

# Intuition check of number of sequences per sample
min(sample_sums(sed_phy)) ## min = 20826

# scale water_physeq to minimum number of reads
scaled_sed_physeq <- 
  sed_phy %>% 
  scale_reads(round = "matround")

# melt physeq into data frame for all time points 
scaled_sed_physeq_24 <- scaled_sed_physeq 

# pull unique methane cycler taxonomic information 
scaled_sed_24_df <- scaled_sed_physeq_24 %>% 
  speedyseq::transform_sample_counts(function(x) x/sum(x)) %>% # transform to relative abundance here
  speedyseq::psmelt()  # melt into dataframe 

# save phyloseq object
save(scaled_sed_24_df, file = "data/01_phyloseq/scaled_sed_24_df.RData")
```  

# FAPROTAXv2 - Predict Metabolic Functions (CH4 Cyclers)
Now that we have saved our phyloseq objects from our water and sediment samples, we will be using FAPROTAXv2 to identify which ASVs are methanotrophs or methanogens. 

This is different from the original FAPROTAXv1 which uses taxonomic identification based on the SILVA database. Although it does understand GreenGenes2 naming, with the updated GreenGenes2 taxonomic identification, it does predict less which makes sense since it is now incorporating metagenomic names. Instead we will be using FAPROTAXv2's function to take the representative 16S rRNA sequences and place it on a phylogenetic tree using a reference tree to functionally predict ASVs. We will then take those ASVs and integrate it with our taxonomy table to see who is identified as what, preferably at the genus level.

### Water - Create FASTA File
Here we will start with a classic OTU table in TSV format but without taxonomic identities. Instead we will have 16S rRNA sequences in a fasta format to place OTUs on FAPROTAX reference tree and functionally annotate from there
```{r faprotax2-ref16S-prep-water}
# set seed
set.seed(09091999)

# 1. Create otu table 
classic_otu_table_water <- water_physeq_24 %>%
  otu_table %>%
  psmelt() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sample, values_from = Abundance) 

write_tsv(classic_otu_table_water, file = paste0("data/02A_Water_FAPROTAXv2/water_otu_table.tsv"))

# create fasta file 
otu_water_24 <- psmelt(water_physeq_24) %>%
  dplyr::select(OTU, Kingdom:ASVseqs) %>% 
    distinct(OTU, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # i think one unique otu is fine?
  mutate(taxonomy = paste(Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, sep=";")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(OTU,ASVseqs)


# use biostrings to create fasta file 
dna_seqs <- DNAStringSet(otu_water_24$ASVseqs)
names(dna_seqs) <- otu_water_24$OTU
writeXStringSet(dna_seqs, "data/02A_Water_FAPROTAXv2/water_16S_seqs.fasta")

# intuition check, no news is good news
# Check if OTU IDs match between the two files
otu_ids_table <- otu_water_24$OTU
otu_ids_fasta <- names(dna_seqs)

identical(sort(otu_ids_table), sort(otu_ids_fasta)) # check id table

stopifnot(identical(names(dna_seqs), otu_water_24$OTU)) # check that fasta df is good, no news is good news
```
Now that we have created our .fasta file from our water samples, we can now run FAPROTAXv2 on them to functionally predict.

### Water - Run FAPROTAXv2
First we will align our sequences to the reference sequences using mafft.
```{r water-faprotax2-fastas, engine = "bash", engine.opts = "l", eval = FALSE}
# move directory
cd data/02A_Water_FAPROTAXv2

# get mafft onto path -- make sure to copy this in terminal 
export PATH=/programs/mafft/bin:$PATH


# align our 16S rRNA fasta list to FAPROTAX2 database reference OR align through mafft GUI website if crashing
/programs/mafft/bin/mafft --auto --addfragments water_16S_seqs.fasta --thread -12 --keeplength SILVA_FOCAL_ALIGNMENTS_SANITIZED_SUBSET.fasta > water_output_alignment.fasta

# gui website code that was run
mafft --thread 12 --inputorder --keeplength --anysymbol --maxambiguous 0.0 --addfragments fragments --auto input > output

# run script to functionally annotate
# since we have already created alignment we place our aligned sequences in already and no need to add reference file

# run script to create phylogenetic tree
# first set environment to have epa-ng to create tree
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc-7.3.0/lib64:/usr/local/gcc-7.3.0/lib
export PATH=/programs/epa-ng-0.3.8/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH # was having issues for getting Rcpp to work but this got it to go!

# run script with aligned mafft aligned fasta file and tree
# running with default for now which uses the binomial hsp algorithm
Rscript faprotax.R -i water_otu_table.tsv -a alignment_ch4water.fasta -o ch4_water_function_table_16S.tsv --out_intermediates ch4_water_intermediates2 -d /local//workdir/sna49/FS_CH4_Mech_Ray_LO_Letters/data/02A_Water_FAPROTAXv2 -r ch4_water_report.txt  --otu_names_are_in_column "OTU" --hsp_algorithm "binomial"
```

### Water - Extract Predicted FAPROTAXv2 Results
Now we will get our function table and find the predicted metabolic functions that correspond to methane cycling, methanogens or methanotrophs. It will provide the ASV as well as the predicted function.

First we will extract all functions then narrow in on CH4 cyclers. This will also be paired with taxonomic identification of known methane cyclers at the genus level.

ASVs not classified to the family or genus level were filtered out from analysis despite FAPROTAXv2 predictions
```{r pull-faprotaxv2-asvs}
# Read the text file of faprotaxv2 report from the previous chunk!
lines <- readLines("data/02A_Water_FAPROTAXv2/ch4_water_report.txt")

# create empty vectors
function_group <- c()
asv_ids <- c()

# temporary variable to store current function name
current_function <- NA

for (line in lines) {
  line <- str_trim(line)
  
  # function group name
  if (str_detect(line, ":$")) {
    current_function <- str_extract(line, "^[^\\s(]+")  # gets function name before the space
  }
  
  # reads asv lines (i.e. ASV_8 (P = 1))
  if (str_detect(line, "^ASV_\\d+")) {
    asv_id <- str_extract(line, "ASV_\\d+")
    function_group <- c(function_group, current_function)
    asv_ids <- c(asv_ids, asv_id)
  }
}

# Combine into dataframe
asv_df <- data.frame(function_group, asv_id = asv_ids)

# View if curious!
#View(asv_df)


# now lets specifically pull out the ch4 cyclers
water_ch4_cyclers_asv_df <- asv_df %>%

  ) %>%

```
Here we used FAPROTAXv2 along with manual identification to functionally predict methanogens and methanotrophs in the water column. 

We created:
1. **water_ch4_cylers_physeq** phyloseq object that has all 2024 time points and filtered for *only* methane cyclers

2. **water_ch4_cyclers_df** data frame that will be used for plotting that includes total cell counts and reformatted names such as depth and solar treatment. This was also saved as a .csv file called "water_ch4_cyclers.csv"

### Sediment - Create FASTA File
Here we will start with a classic OTU table in TSV format but without taxonomic identities. Instead we will have 16S rRNA sequences in a fasta format to place OTUs on FAPROTAX reference tree and functionally annotate from there

```
Now that we have created our .fasta file from our water samples, we can now run FAPROTAXv2 on them to functionally predict.

### Sediment - Run FAPROTAXv2
First we will align our sequences to the reference sequences using mafft.
```{r sed-faprotax2-fastas, engine = "bash", engine.opts = "l", eval = FALSE}
# move directory
cd data/02B_Sediment_FAPROTAXv2

# get mafft onto path -- make sure to copy this in terminal or nothing happens <3
export PATH=/programs/mafft/bin:$PATH


# align our 16S rRNA fasta list to FAPROTAX2 database reference OR align through mafft GUI website if crashing
/programs/mafft/bin/mafft --auto --addfragments sed_16S_seqs.fasta --thread -12 --keeplength SILVA_FOCAL_ALIGNMENTS_SANITIZED_SUBSET.fasta > sed_output_alignment.fasta

# gui website code that was run
mafft --thread 12 --inputorder --keeplength --anysymbol --maxambiguous 0.0 --addfragments fragments --auto input > output

# run script to functionally annotate
# since we have already created alignment we place our aligned sequences in already and no need to add reference file

# run script to create phylogenetic tree
# first set environment to have epa-ng to create tree
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc-7.3.0/lib64:/usr/local/gcc-7.3.0/lib
export PATH=/programs/epa-ng-0.3.8/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH # was having issues for getting Rcpp to work but this got it to go!

# run script with aligned mafft aligned fasta file and tree
# running with default for now which uses the binomial hsp algorithm
Rscript faprotax.R -i sed_otu_table.tsv -a alignment_ch4sed.fasta -o ch4_sed_function_table_16S.tsv --out_intermediates ch4_sed_intermediates -d /local/workdir/sna49/FS_CH4_Mech_Ray_LO_Letters/data/02B_Sediment_FAPROTAXv2 -r ch4_sed_report.txt  --otu_names_are_in_column "OTU" --hsp_algorithm "binomial"
```

### Sediment - Extract Predicted FAPROTAXv2 Results
Now we will get our function table and find the predicted metabolic functions that correspond to methane cycling, methanogens or methanotrophs. It will provide the ASV as well as the predicted function.

First we will extract all functions then narrow in on CH4 cyclers. This will also be paired with taxonomic identification of known methane cyclers at the genus level.

ASVs not classified to the family or genus level were filtered out from analysis despite FAPROTAXv2 predictions
```{r pull-faprotaxv2-sed-asvs}
# Read the text file of faprotaxv2 report from the previous chunk!
lines <- readLines("data/02B_Sediment_FAPROTAXv2/ch4_sed_report.txt")

asv_ids <- c()

# temporary variable to store current function name

  if (str_detect(line, ":$")) {
    current_function <- str_extract(line, "^[^\\s(]+")  # gets function name before the space
  }
  
  # reads asv lines (i.e. ASV_8 (P = 1))
  if (str_detect(line, "^ASV_\\d+")) {
    asv_id <- str_extract(line, "ASV_\\d+")
    function_group <- c(function_group, current_function)
    asv_ids <- c(asv_ids, asv_id)
  }

Here we used FAPROTAXv2 along with manual identification to functionally predict methanogens and methanotrophs in the sediments. 

We created:
1. **sed_ch4_cylers_physeq** phyloseq object that has all 2024 time points and filtered for *only* methane cyclers. This was from our scaled phyloseq that was scaled down to the minimum read number 20826

2. **sed_ch4_cyclers_df** data frame that will be used for plotting that includes relative abundance and reformatted names such as depth and solar treatment. This was also saved as a .csv file called "sed_ch4_cyclers.csv"


# Normality of Methane Cyclers in Ponds
**Is our data normally distributed?**

Lets configure our dataframe and then check to see how our data is distributed with Q-Q plots, density histogram, and Shapiro-Wilk test.

We will split this up by sample type where we will do water first then sediments in next chunk

### Water
```{r normality-water}
# factor solar progress
water_ch4_cyclers_df$solar_progress <- factor(
  water_ch4_cyclers_df$solar_progress,
  levels = c("FPV", "Open"))

# factor depth
water_ch4_cyclers_df$Depth_Class <- factor(
  water_ch4_cyclers_df$Depth_Class,
  levels = c("Surface Water", "Bottom Water"))

# now add interaction column to our df
water_ch4_cyclers_df <- water_ch4_cyclers_df %>%
  mutate(group = interaction(CH4_Cycler, Depth_Class, sep = " ")) %>% 
  group_by(Pond, solar_progress, Depth_Class, group, JDate, CH4_Cycler) %>%
  summarise(
    total_abundance = sum(Abundance, na.rm = TRUE), # total across all samples
    .groups = "drop"
  )


# qq plot to visualize normality
ggplot(water_ch4_cyclers_df, aes(sample = total_abundance)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Q-Q Plots: Water Abundance by Group")

# lets plot density histogram by group too
ggplot(water_ch4_cyclers_df, aes(x = total_abundance, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, alpha = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram and Density of Abundance by Group",
       x = "Absolute Cell Abundance",
       y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# now lets plot density histogram by further facetting by treatment
ggplot(water_ch4_cyclers_df, aes(x = total_abundance, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, alpha = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ group + solar_progress, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram and Density of Order Abundance by Group and Solar Progress",
       x = "Absolute Cell Abundance",
       y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# shapiro test
water_ch4_cyclers_df %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(
    shapiro_p = shapiro.test(total_abundance)$p.value,
    n = n()
  )

```

Based on our data with the qq plots we see that the points more or less fit the line. but when we investigate further with the density histograms, the data lacks a clear unimodal distribution. Now, let's check this out further with a Shapiro-Wilk test. When we run our Shapiro-Wilk test to also test for a normal distribution if p > 0.05 the data is likely normal but if p < 0.05 then the data is not normal.

# A tibble: 4 × 3
  group                        shapiro_p     n
  <fct>                            <dbl> <int>
1 Methanogen Surface Water   0.00000185     24
2 Methanotroph Surface Water 0.000267       24
3 Methanogen Bottom Water    0.000000393    24
4 Methanotroph Bottom Water  0.000445       24

The data is not normal! 

Therefore, we will need to use non-parametric stats to statitistically test the data. 


### Sediment - Normality 

We will be running this for all 2024 time points 
```{r normality-sed}
# level
sed_ch4_cyclers_df$solar_progress <- factor(
  sed_ch4_cyclers_df$solar_progress,
  levels = c("FPV", "Open"))

# interaction grouping and relative abundance calc
sed_ch4_cyclers_df <- sed_ch4_cyclers_df %>%
  mutate(group = interaction(CH4_Cycler, Depth_Class, sep = " ")) %>% 
  group_by(Pond, solar_progress, group, JDate, CH4_Cycler) %>%
  summarise(
    rel_abundance = sum(Abundance, na.rm = TRUE), # total across all samples
    .groups = "drop"
  )


# qq plot to visualize normality
ggplot(sed_ch4_cyclers_df, aes(sample = rel_abundance)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Q-Q Plots: Order Abundance by Group")

# lets plot density histogram by group too
ggplot(sed_ch4_cyclers_df, aes(x = rel_abundance, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, alpha = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ group, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram and Density of Relative Abundance by Group",
       x = "Relative Abundance",
       y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# now lets plot density histogram by further facetting by treatment
ggplot(sed_ch4_cyclers_df, aes(x = rel_abundance, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, alpha = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ group + solar_progress, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram and Density of Relative Abundance by Group and Solar Progress",
       x = "Relative Abundance",
       y = "Density") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# shapiro test
sed_ch4_cyclers_df %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(
    shapiro_p = shapiro.test(rel_abundance)$p.value,
    n = n()
  )
```

Based on our data with the qq plots and the density histograms, data does not seem to be clearly normally distributed. Shapiro-Wilk test to also test for a normal distribution if p > 0.05 the data is likely normal but if p < 0.05 then the data is not normal.

  group                 shapiro_p     n
  <fct>                     <dbl> <int>
1 Methanogen Sediment      0.137     23
2 Methanotroph Sediment    0.0184    23

Methanotrophs are not normally distributed but but methanogens are which is interesting. but will still go with two-sample Wilcoxon tests

# Fig 2 - Abundance of Methane Cyclers

In this plot we will calculate the absolute abundance of methane cyclers in water column and the relative abundance in sediments to see methane cyclers overtime and with a box plot to show abundance as well.

## Fig S3: PERMANOVA

PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) is a non-parametric, permutation-based test used to compare groups of objects based on a distance matrix. The goal is to test the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are equivalent in the space defined by the dissimilarity measure. 

```{r S1-calc-bray-metadata}
#### WATER COLUMN: All methane cyclers
# calculate Bray-Curtis PERMANOVA using phyloseq distance
water_bray <- phyloseq::distance(water_ch4_cyclers_physeq, method = "bray", binary = FALSE)

# pull out metadata 
water_metadata <- water_ch4_cyclers_physeq %>%
  sample_data() %>%
  data.frame()


#### SEDIMENT: All methane cyclers
# calculate Bray-Curtis PERMANOVA using phyloseq distance
sed_bray <- phyloseq::distance(sed_ch4_cyclers_physeq, method = "bray", binary = FALSE)

# pull out metadata 
sed_metadata <- sed_ch4_cyclers_physeq %>%
  sample_data() %>%
  data.frame()
```



### Water 

Here we are performing a PERMANOVA on the water column methane cyclers throughout the entire sampling season.

```{r permanova-water}
# Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using Distance Matrices
# aka PERMANOVA using the adonis2 function from vegan 

#1. Test the individual terms for significance
# Testing if the centroids of solar progress are different: significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(water_bray ~ solar_progress, data = water_metadata, by = "terms")

# Now testing to see if centroids of depth_class are different: not significant p = 0.19
adonis2(water_bray ~ Depth_Class, data = water_metadata, by = "terms")

# Does pond matter? significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(water_bray ~ Pond, data = water_metadata, by = "terms")

# Does date matter? significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(water_bray ~ JDate, data = water_metadata, by = "terms")

#2. Test the terms together
# Now lets see the effect of each pond by date_collected and solar progress
water_permanova <- adonis2(water_bray ~ solar_progress * Pond * JDate, data = water_metadata, by = "terms"); water_permanova
```
With our PERMANOVA we find that treatment (solar_progress), day of year sampled (JDate - Julian date), and Pond is significant but depth class alone is not.

When we create a model with treatment, pond, and date these are all significant (p < 0.001 ***). 
- Solar progress is responsible for explaining  12.8% of variance and has a strong structuring effect on the water column community composition. This has the highest F value meaning that the between group differences are larger than within group variance (F = 9.4)

- Pond is also significant explains 15.5% of variance but is weaker than treatment (solar_progress) (F = 2.8). Even though it explains more variation than treatment, there is more variation in ponds than between ponds. 

- Date (JDate) is also strong and explains 8.6% of variance and is also weighted heavier (F = 6.3). The temporal effect is seen in the first axis as time progresses throughout the season.

- The interaction between treatment and date explains 5.9% of variance and is an important but moderate factor in its effect size for structuring community (F = 4.3)


Together the PERMANOVA explains only about half the variance seen with 48.9% remaining

### Sediments 
Here we are performing a PERMANOVA on the sediment methane cyclers throughout the entire sampling season
```{r permanova-sediments}
# Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using Distance Matrices
# aka PERMANOVA using the adonis2 function from vegan 

#1. Test the individual terms for significance
# Testing if the centroids of solar progress are different: significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(sed_bray ~ solar_progress, data = sed_metadata, by = "terms")

# Does pond matter? significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(sed_bray ~ Pond, data = sed_metadata, by = "terms")

# Does date matter? significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(sed_bray ~ JDate, data = sed_metadata, by = "terms")

#2. Test the terms together
# Now lets see the effect of each pond by date_collected and solar progress
sediment_permanova <- adonis2(sed_bray ~ solar_progress * Pond * JDate, data = sed_metadata, by = "terms"); sediment_permanova
```
With our PERMANOVA we find that treatment (solar_progress), day of year sampled (JDate - Julian date), and Pond is significant factors.

When we create a model with treatment, pond, and date these are all significant (p < 0.001 ***). 
- treatment = solar_progress is important for explaining 11.8% of variation and has the largest effect on structuring the community (F = 10.1). This explains the separation along the first axis

- pond explains the most variation (25.9%) and also has a substantial effect on structuring the community (F = 5.5) 

- Date explains 10.1% of variation and also has temporal effect (F = 8.7) that shapes communities


This explains 60.2% of variance with 39.8% in the residuals. 

## Fig 3: Betadisper
We are running betadispr to test variances/dispersions

When computing PERMANOVA, we must also perform betadispr analysis when analyzing beta diversity in microbial ecology. We must do it after PERMANOVA because we need to look into the assumption of PERMANOVA which is the homogeneity of group dispersions aka variances. If this assumption is violated then the PERMANOVA results might be driven by dispersion rather than true differences in community composition.

Always run betadisper() and permutest() after PERMANOVA to test whether the groups have similar within-group variation.

It works by first taking ina. distance matrix and calculates the centroid of each group in multivariate space (note it does not test for significane). After computing within-group distances, we will run permutest() to see whether those dispersiosn differ significantly between groups using PERMANOVA

The permutest works like this: - null hypothesis (H0): all groups have equal multivariate dispersion and a compute a new F-statistic for each permutation.

The p-value is the proportion of permutations where the F is as extreme or more extreme than the observed F.
The result from permutest() is a robust non-parametric p-value testing whether dispersion differs across groups.
If p > 0.05 (not significant), the PERMANOVA result is reliable.

If p = 0.05 (significant), be cautious—group differences may be due to dispersion, not composition! However, not all is lost as we may expect this to be biologically true.

adonis - compares centroids to see if significant difference. betadispr - compares variance/distance from centroid

### Water
```{r betadispr-water}
# Homogeneity of Disperson test with beta dispr

## Bray-Curtis
betadispr_water_pond <- betadisper(water_bray, water_metadata$Pond)
betadispr_water_solar <- betadisper(water_bray, water_metadata$solar_progress)
betadispr_water_depth <- betadisper(water_bray, water_metadata$Depth_Class)
betadispr_water_JDate <- betadisper(water_bray, water_metadata$JDate)

# permutest() performs a non-parametric permutation test, which is robust and valid for the kind of data used in beta diversity analysis (e.g., dissimilarity matrices).
permutest(betadispr_water_pond) # not significant p = 0.256 

permutest(betadispr_water_solar) # significant p = 0.011 **

permutest(betadispr_water_depth) # not significant p = 0.417 

permutest(betadispr_water_JDate) # significant p = 0.006 **
```
With betadispr we find the PERMANOVA results are mostly valid where pond variation is consistent. The PERMANOVA and betadispr find that depth is not significant meaning that depth doesnt structure the community. This makes sense between the ponds are so shallow so they are more likely to be similar.

But treatment and date are significant meaning the differences may be due to dispersion and not composition. This could be because of temporal reasons where communities change over time with the season.

### Sediment 
```{r betadispr-sed}
# Homogeneity of Disperson test with beta dispr
## Bray-Curtis
betadispr_sed_pond <- betadisper(sed_bray, sed_metadata$Pond)
betadispr_sed_solar <- betadisper(sed_bray, sed_metadata$solar_progress)
betadispr_sed_JDate <- betadisper(sed_bray, sed_metadata$JDate)

# permutest() performs a non-parametric permutation test, which is robust and valid for the kind of data used in beta diversity analysis (e.g., dissimilarity matrices).
permutest(betadispr_sed_pond) # not significant p = 0.661

permutest(betadispr_sed_solar) # not significant p = 0.673

permutest(betadispr_sed_JDate) # not significant p = 0.162
```
With betadispr we find the PERMANOVA results are are valid as pond, treatment, and date are not significant but significant in the PERMANOVA. Thus our PERMANOVA result is reliable and the differences between groups are due to location/centroids of groups rather than differences in variation within groups

## Fig S1: PERMANOVA 

PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) is a non-parametric, permutation-based test used to compare groups of objects based on a distance matrix. The goal is to test the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of groups are equivalent in the space defined by the dissimilarity measure. 

### Methanogens

Here we are performing a PERMANOVA on the sediment methanogen and methanotrophs
```{r permanova-sed-methanogens}

        data = sed_methanogens_metadata, by = "terms")

# Does date matter? significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(sed_gen_bray ~ as.factor(JDate), 
        data = sed_methanogens_metadata, by = "terms")

#2. Test the terms together
# Now lets see the effect of each pond by date_collected and solar progress
sed_methanogens_permanova <- 
  adonis2(sed_gen_bray ~ solar_progress * Pond * JDate,

  data.frame()

# Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance Using Distance Matrices

        data = sed_methanotrophs_metadata, by = "terms")

# Does pond matter? significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(sed_troph_bray ~ Pond, 
        data = sed_methanotrophs_metadata, by = "terms")

# Does date matter? significant p = 0.001 ***
adonis2(sed_troph_bray ~ as.factor(JDate), 
        data = sed_methanotrophs_metadata, by = "terms")

#2. Test the terms together
# Now lets see the effect of each pond by date_collected and solar progress
sed_methanotrophs_permanova <- 
  adonis2(sed_troph_bray ~ solar_progress * Pond * JDate, 
        data = sed_methanotrophs_metadata, by = "terms")

# Show the results! 
sed_methanotrophs_permanova
```

**Methanogens**
With our PERMANOVA we find that treatment (solar_progress), day of year sampled (JDate - Julian date), and Pond is significant 

Treatment explains 11.8% of the variance and has the largest effect size (F = 10.5) but pond explains the most variation, 28.2%, and contributes to the community but weaker than treatment (F = 6.22). JDate explains 9.0% of variation but is the second most important term for its weight contributing to structuring thet community. 

Solar progress and time explains 2.5% of the variation but is not a strong contributer to the community. Pond and time explais 10% of variation but has a smaller effect on community structure.

Together this explains 62% of the variation.

**Methanotrophs**

With our PERMANOVA we see that Pond explains the most variance (20.4%) but does not have a strong effect on community structure (F = 3.9). There is a temporal effect along the first axis due to time that explains 13.1% of data and is a strong factor for shaping the community (F = 10.0). Treatment is important for explaining 10.1% of variance and is teh second most important factor for shaping the community which we kinda see along the second axis (F = 7.7)

The interactions of pond and date explain 9.7% of the variance but is not an important factor for shaping our community (F = 1.9). 

The interaction of solar treatment and pond is > 0.05 (p = 0.095) indicating that their interaction is not strong and important for shaping the community. while it does answer 2.2% of variation, it has the smallest effect size (F = 1.7) 

Together these variables explain 56% of the data

# permutest() performs a non-parametric permutation test, which is robust and valid for the kind of data used in beta diversity analysis (e.g., dissimilarity matrices).
permutest(betadispr_sed_methanogens_pond) # not significant p = 0.659

permutest(betadispr_sed_methanogens_solar) # not significant p = 0.067

permutest(betadispr_sed_methanogens_JDate) # not significant p = 0.44
```

### Methanotrophs
```{r betadisper-sed-methanotrophs}
# 2. methanotrophs 
# Homogeneity of Disperson test with beta dispr

## Bray-Curtis
betadispr_sed_methanotrophs_pond <- 
  betadisper(sed_troph_bray, sed_methanotrophs_metadata$Pond)

betadispr_sed_methanotrophs_solar <- 
  betadisper(sed_troph_bray, sed_methanotrophs_metadata$solar_progress)

betadispr_sed_methanotrophs_JDate <-
  betadisper(sed_troph_bray, sed_methanotrophs_metadata$JDate)


# permutest() performs a non-parametric permutation test, which is robust and valid for the kind of data used in beta diversity analysis (e.g., dissimilarity matrices).
permutest(betadispr_sed_methanotrophs_pond) # not significant p = 0.515

permutest(betadispr_sed_methanotrophs_solar) # not significant p = 0.682

permutest(betadispr_sed_methanotrophs_JDate) # significant p = 0.011 *
```
**Methanogens**
With betadispr we find the PERMANOVA results are are valid as pond, treatment, and date are not significant but significant in the PERMANOVA. Thus our PERMANOVA result is reliable and the differences between groups are due to location/centroids of groups rather than differences in variation within groups 

**Methanotrophs**
With betadispr we find the PERMANOVA results are are valid as pond and treatment are not significant but significant in the PERMANOVA. Thus our PERMANOVA result is reliable and the differences between groups are due to location/centroids of groups rather than differences in variation within groups 

However, date is statistically significant in PERMANOVA and in the betadispr indicating that theres variability in within the sampling dates so there are likely differences in community composition and probably heterogeneity over time.

## Differential Abundance 

Now we will calculate the differential abundance between our water and sediment samples. First I will try to do the original methane cyclers in water and sediments. but i may also further break it down into sediment methane cycler type.

### Water

Note as of this step the results do change in that methanobacteriales is not differentially abundant anymore and we have a reduction in asv_1479 and 976. but all asvs belong to methylococcales order

```
When we look at the water column of just our methane cyclers, we see that there are only log fold change increases. It is no suprise that Methylococcales has 4 differentially abundant ASVs, but ASV 32 is a log fold change just shy of 3! I am kinda shocked that the Methanobacteriales ASV 1063 is differentially abundant in the water column of solar ponds...

There is a differentially abundant ASV Methanosarcinales_A_2632 that is increased in solar ponds! When we plot the abundance overtime this ASV is barely in the community but it is higher in solar ponds. Doesnt really feel worth it to report considering its a minor contribution to community.

### Analysis Notes

**Water Samples** When we filter for our methanotrophs and methanogens
at the **Order level** (we still have Phylum and Class level
information) we see that we have:


When identifying methanotrophs it is important to remember that all
methanotrophs are methylotrophs (consume methanole, methylamine, or
formate as energy source but **not methane**) but not all methylotophs
are methanotrophs. Methanotrophs are a subset of methylotrophs but
consume methane as their sole carbon and energy source. Methanotrophs
typically start with "Methyl" in their order name but verified through
literature review and public databases.

Putative methanogens and methanotrophs were identified based on
taxonomic classification and verified through literature review and
publically available databases (NCBI).

**Sediment Samples** Just like our water samples, we will filter for
methanogens and methanotrophs at the **Order level**

Putative methanogens and methanotrophs were identified based on
taxonomic classification and verified through literature review and
publically available databases (NCBI).
